				</p>
				<p>
				3. IF ANY PART OF THE PLATFORM LINKS YOU TO OTHER WEBSITES, THOSE WEBSITES DO NOT OPERATE UNDER THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND WE DO NOT ACCEPT ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY ARISING FROM THOSE WEBSITES. WE SUGGEST YOU READ AND UNDERSTAND THOSE WEBSITES’ PRIVACY POLICY BEFORE YOU PROVIDE YOUR PERSONAL DATA TO THOSE WEBSITES.
				</p>
				<p>
				4. WE USE COOKIES (AN ALPHANUMERIC IDENTIFIER THAT WE TRANSFER TO YOUR COMPUTER’S OR MOBILE DEVICE’S HARD DRIVE SO THAT WE CAN RECOGNISE YOUR WEB BROWSER OR MOBILE DEVICE, TRACK YOUR VISITS TO THE PLATFORM OR REMEMBER YOUR USERNAME AND/OR PASSWORD EACH TIME LOG-IN) TO MONITOR YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORM. ALL SUCH DEMOGRAPHIC DATA COLLECTED THROUGH COOKIES ARE NOT PERSONAL DATA AND WE MAY USE THIS DATA IN AGGREGATED, STATISTICAL AND/OR ANONYMISED FORM. YOU MAY DISABLE COOKIES BY CHANGING THE SETTINGS ON YOUR WEB BROWSER OR MOBILE DEVICE, ALTHOUGH THIS MAY MEAN THAT CERTAIN FEATURES ON THE PLATFORM WILL NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY IF YOU SET YOUR WEB BROWSER OR MOBILE DEVICE TO NOT ACCEPT COOKIES.

				<p>
				5.

				</p>
				<p>
				6. PLEASE NOTE THAT WHEN YOU FIRST INSTALL OUR MOBILE APPLICATION ON YOUR MOBILE DEVICE, WE WILL SET UP AN ACCOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH THAT MOBILE DEVICE (“ACCOUNT”). WE WILL COLLECT AND USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY, WHENEVER YOU ACTIVATE OUR MOBILE APPLICATION ON THAT MOBILE DEVICE. THIS USE INCLUDES LINKING YOUR PERSONAL DATA WITH YOUR ACCOUNT. MOST MOBILE PLATFORMS (IOS, ANDROID, ETC) HAVE DIFFERENT PERMISSION SYSTEMS FOR OBTAINING YOUR CONSENT. THE IOS PLATFORM WILL ALERT YOU THE FIRST TIME OUR MOBILE APPLICATION WANTS PERMISSION TO ACCESS CERTAIN TYPES OF DATA AND WILL LET YOU CONSENT (OR NOT CONSENT) TO THAT REQUEST. ANDROID DEVICES WILL NOTIFY YOU OF THE PERMISSIONS THAT OUR MOBILE APPLICATION SEEKS BEFORE YOU FIRST USE THE MOBILE APPLICATION, AND YOUR USE CONSTITUTES YOUR CONSENT.
				</p>
				<p>
				7. THE PLATFORM MAY INTEGRATE WITH SOCIAL SHARING FEATURES AND OTHER RELATED TOOLS WHICH ALLOW YOU TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH YOUR FRIENDS OR THE PUBLIC, DEPENDING ON THE SETTINGS YOU ESTABLISH WITH THE SOCIAL SHARING NETWORK. THE SOCIAL SHARING NETWORK’S USE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA MADE AVAILABLE BY WANDERCARE IS GOVERNED BY THAT SOCIAL SHARING NETWORK’S PRIVACY POLICY, NOT BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY. BY CONNECTING YOUR SOCIAL SHARING NETWORK ACCOUNT THROUGH THE PLATFORM, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL DATA FROM YOUR SOCIAL SHARING NETWORK ACCOUNT ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR PRIVACY SETTINGS YOU HAVE SET UP UNDER YOUR SOCIAL SHARING NETWORK ACCOUNT AND FOR THE PURPOSES PROVIDED UNDER THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

WHERE THE LOCATION SERVICES INFORMATION IS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE, WE WILL GIVE YOU THE OPTIONS TO MANAGE YOUR DISCLOSURE OF THIS INFORMATION. DEPENDING ON THE FUNCTIONALITIES AVAILABLE ON YOUR COMPUTER OR MOBILE DEVICE, YOU MAY BENEFIT FROM ADVANCED OPTIONS TO MANAGE THE LOCATION SERVICES INFORMATION. A COMPUTER OR MOBILE DEVICE MAY REPORT ITS GPS LOCATION AT THE TIME YOU INTERACT WITH US IF THE LOCATION SERVICES SETTINGS ARE ENABLED. SUCH INFORMATION IS NOT IDENTIFIED AS PERSONAL DATA, EXCEPT WHERE WE ARE REQUIRED TO DO OTHERWISE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.
				</p>
				<p>
				9. OUR COLLECTION OF YOUR COMPUTER OR MOBILE DEVICE LOCATION INFORMATION IS SOLELY AT YOUR DISCRETION.
